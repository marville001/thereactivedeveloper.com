## **Hey Friends ðŸ‘‹, I'm Martin. Nice to Meet You**

I'm **Martin Mwangi**. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Dedan Kimathi University Of technology](https://www.dkut.ac.ke/). I'm currently a Software Engineer working with .NET, NestJs, ReactJs, Angular, NodeJs, GraphQl, Postgres, MongoDB and TypeScript.

I'm also learning some DevOps tools on AWS and Azure.

The main purpose of starting my own portfolio is to showcase my projects, document my learning journey through blogs and also to document the books am reading by writing book notes. *I hope you get to check them out!*
